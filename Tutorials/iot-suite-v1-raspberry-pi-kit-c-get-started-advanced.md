> The remote monitoring solution provisions a set of Azure services in your Azure subscription. The deployment reflects a real enterprise architecture. To avoid unnecessary Azure consumption charges, delete your instance of the preconfigured solution at azureiotsuite.com when you have finished with it. If you need the preconfigured solution again, you can easily recreate it. For more information about reducing consumption while the remote monitoring solution runs, see [Configuring Azure IoT Suite preconfigured solutions for demo purposes][lnk-demo-config].

## View the solution dashboard

The solution dashboard enables you to manage the deployed solution. For example, you can view telemetry, add devices, and invoke methods.

1. When the provisioning is complete and the tile for your preconfigured solution indicates **Ready**, choose **Launch** to open your remote monitoring solution portal in a new tab.

    ![Launch the preconfigured solution][img-launch-solution]

1. By default, the solution portal shows the *dashboard*. You can navigate to other areas of the solution portal using the menu on the left-hand side of the page.

    ![Remote monitoring preconfigured solution dashboard][img-menu]

## Add a device

For a device to connect to the preconfigured solution, it must identify itself to IoT Hub using valid credentials. You can retrieve the device credentials from the solution dashboard. You include the device credentials in your client application later in this tutorial.

If you haven't already done so, add a custom device to your remote monitoring solution. Complete the following steps in the solution dashboard:

1. In the lower left-hand corner of the dashboard, click **Add a device**.

   ![Add a device][1]

## Prepare your Raspberry Pi

### Install Raspbian

If this is the first time you are using your Raspberry Pi, you need to install the Raspbian operating system using NOOBS on the SD card included in the kit. The [Raspberry Pi Software Guide][lnk-install-raspbian] describes how to install an operating system on your Raspberry Pi. This tutorial assumes you have installed the Raspbian operating system on your Raspberry Pi.


> The SD card included in the [Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi 3][lnk-starter-kits] already has NOOBS installed. You can boot the Raspberry Pi from this card and choose to install the Raspbian OS.

### Set up the hardware

This tutorial uses the BME280 sensor included in the [Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi 3][lnk-starter-kits] to generate telemetry data. It uses an LED to indicate when the Raspberry Pi processes a method invocation from the solution dashboard.

The components on the bread board are:

- Red LED
- 220-Ohm resistor (red, red, brown)
- BME280 sensor

The following diagram shows how to connect your hardware:

![Hardware setup for Raspberry Pi][img-connection-diagram]

The following table summarizes the connections from the Raspberry Pi to the components on the breadboard:

| Raspberry Pi            | Breadboard             |Color         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| GND (Pin 14)            | LED -ve pin (18A)      | Purple          |
| GPCLK0 (Pin 7)          | Resistor (25A)         | Orange          |
| SPI_CE0 (Pin 24)        | CS (39A)               | Blue          |
| SPI_SCLK (Pin 23)       | SCK (36A)              | Yellow        |
| SPI_MISO (Pin 21)       | SDO (37A)              | White         |
| SPI_MOSI (Pin 19)       | SDI (38A)              | Green         |
| GND (Pin 6)             | GND (35A)              | Black         |
| 3.3 V (Pin 1)           | 3Vo (34A)              | Red           |

To complete the hardware setup, you need to:

- Connect your Raspberry Pi to the power supply included in the kit.
- Connect your Raspberry Pi to your network using the Ethernet cable included in your kit. Alternatively, you can set up [Wireless Connectivity][lnk-pi-wireless] for your Raspberry Pi.

You have now completed the hardware setup of your Raspberry Pi.

### Sign in and access the terminal

You have two options to access a terminal environment on your Raspberry Pi:

- If you have a keyboard and monitor connected to your Raspberry Pi, you can use the Raspbian GUI to access a terminal window.

- Access the command line on your Raspberry Pi using SSH from your desktop machine.

#### Use a terminal Window in the GUI

The default credentials for Raspbian are username **pi** and password **raspberry**. In the task bar in the GUI, you can launch the **Terminal** utility using the icon that looks like a monitor.

#### Sign in with SSH

You can use SSH for command-line access to your Raspberry Pi. The article [SSH (Secure Shell)][lnk-pi-ssh] describes how to configure SSH on your Raspberry Pi, and how to connect from [Windows][lnk-ssh-windows] or [Linux & Mac OS][lnk-ssh-linux].

Sign in with username **pi** and password **raspberry**.

#### Optional: Share a folder on your Raspberry Pi

Optionally, you may want to share a folder on your Raspberry Pi with your desktop environment. Sharing a folder enables you to use your preferred desktop text editor (such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)) to edit files on your Raspberry Pi instead of using `nano` or `vi`.

To share a folder with Windows, configure a Samba server on the Raspberry Pi. Alternatively, use the built-in [SFTP](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/) server with an SFTP client on your desktop.

### Enable SPI

Before you can run the sample application, you must enable the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus on the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi communicates with the BME280 sensor device over the SPI bus. Use the following command to edit the configuration file:

```sh
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Find the line:

`#dtparam=spi=on`

- To uncomment the line, delete the `#` at the start.
- Save your changes (**Ctrl-O**, **Enter**) and exit the editor (**Ctrl-X**).
- To enable SPI, reboot the Raspberry Pi. Rebooting disconnects the terminal, you need to sign in again when the Raspberry Pi restarts:

  ```sh
  sudo reboot
  ```

## Download and configure the sample

You can now download and configure the remote monitoring client application on your Raspberry Pi.

### Clone the repositories

If you haven't done so already, clone the required repositories by running the following commands on your Pi:

```sh
cd ~
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit.git
```

### Update the device connection string

Open the sample configuration file in the **nano** editor using the following command:

```sh
nano ~/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/advanced/config/deviceinfo
```

Replace the placeholder values with the device ID and IoT Hub information you created and saved at the start of this tutorial.

When you are done, the contents of the deviceinfo file should look like the following example:

```conf
yourdeviceid
HostName=youriothubname.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=yourdeviceid;SharedAccessKey=yourdevicekey
```

Save your changes (**Ctrl-O**, **Enter**) and exit the editor (**Ctrl-X**).

## Build the sample

If you have not already done so, install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by running the following commands in a terminal on the Raspberry Pi:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ make cmake git libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev
```

You can now build the sample solution on the Raspberry Pi:

```sh
chmod +x ~/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/advanced/1.0/build.sh
~/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/advanced/1.0/build.sh
```

You can now run the sample program on the Raspberry Pi. Enter the command:

  ```sh
  sudo ~/cmake/remote_monitoring/remote_monitoring
  ```

The following sample output is an example of the output you see at the command prompt on the Raspberry Pi:

![Output from Raspberry Pi app][img-raspberry-output]

Press **Ctrl-C** to exit the program at any time.

## View the telemetry

The Raspberry Pi is now sending telemetry to the remote monitoring solution. You can view the telemetry on the solution dashboard. You can also send messages to your Raspberry Pi from the solution dashboard.

- Navigate to the solution dashboard.
- Select your device in the **Device to View** dropdown.
- The telemetry from the Raspberry Pi displays on the dashboard.

![Display telemetry from the Raspberry Pi][img-telemetry-display]

## Initiate the firmware update

The firmware update process downloads and installs an updated version of the device client application on the Raspberry Pi. For more information about the firmware update process, see the description of the firmware update pattern in [Overview of device management with IoT Hub][lnk-update-pattern].

You initiate the firmware update process by invoking a method on the device. This method is asynchronous, and returns as soon as the update process begins. The device uses reported properties to notify the solution about the progress of the update.

You invoke methods on your Raspberry Pi from the solution dashboard. When the Raspberry Pi first connects to the remote monitoring solution, it sends information about the methods it supports. 

[img-telemetry-display]: media/iot-suite-v1-raspberry-pi-kit-view-telemetry-advanced/telemetry.png
[lnk-update-pattern]: ../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-management-overview.md


1. In the solution dashboard, click **Devices** to visit the **Devices** page. Select your Raspberry Pi in the **Device List**. Then choose **Methods**:

    ![List devices in dashboard][img-list-devices]

1. On the **Invoke Method** page, choose **InitiateFirmwareUpdate** in the **Method** dropdown.

1. In the **FWPackageURI** field, enter **https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/raw/master/advanced/2.0/package/remote_monitoring.zip**. This archive file contains the implementation of version 2.0 of the firmware.

1. Choose **InvokeMethod**. The app on the Raspberry Pi sends an acknowledgment back to the solution dashboard. It then starts the firmware update process by downloading the new version of the firmware:

    ![Show method history][img-method-history]

## Observe the firmware update process

You can observe the firmware update process as it runs on the device and by viewing the reported properties in the solution dashboard:

1. You can view the progress in of the update process on the Raspberry Pi:

    ![Show update progress][img-update-progress]

    
    > The remote monitoring app restarts silently when the update completes. Use the command `ps -ef` to verify it is running. If you want to terminate the process, use the `kill` command with the process id.

1. You can view the status of the firmware update, as reported by the device, in the solution portal. The following screenshot shows the status and duration of each stage of the update process, and the new firmware version:

    ![Show job status][img-job-status]

    If you navigate back to the dashboard, you can verify the device is still sending telemetry following the firmware update.


> If you leave the remote monitoring solution running in your Azure account, you are billed for the time it runs. For more information about reducing consumption while the remote monitoring solution runs, see [Configuring Azure IoT Suite preconfigured solutions for demo purposes][lnk-demo-config]. Delete the preconfigured solution from your Azure account when you have finished using it.
