# Connect your Raspberry Pi 3 to the remote monitoring solution and send simulated telemetry using C



This tutorial shows you how to use the Raspberry Pi 3 to simulate temperature and humidity data to send to the cloud. The tutorial uses:

- Raspbian OS, the C programming language, and the Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for C to implement a sample device.
- The IoT Suite remote monitoring preconfigured solution as the cloud-based back end.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you complete the following steps:

- Deploy an instance of the remote monitoring preconfigured solution to your Azure subscription. This step automatically deploys and configures multiple Azure services.
- Set up your device to communicate with your computer and the remote monitoring solution.
- Update the sample device code to connect to the remote monitoring solution, and send simulated telemetry that you can view on the solution dashboard.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need an active Azure subscription.


> If you donâ€™t have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial][lnk-free-trial].

### Required software

You need SSH client on your desktop machine to enable you to remotely access the command line on the Raspberry Pi.

- Windows does not include an SSH client. We recommend using [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).
- Most Linux distributions and Mac OS include the command-line SSH utility. For more information, see [SSH Using Linux or Mac OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md).

### Required hardware

A desktop computer to enable you to connect remotely to the command line on the Raspberry Pi.

[Microsoft IoT Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi 3][lnk-starter-kits] or equivalent components. This tutorial uses the following items from the kit:

- Raspberry Pi 3
- MicroSD Card (with NOOBS)
- A USB Mini cable
- An Ethernet cable

> The remote monitoring solution provisions a set of Azure services in your Azure subscription. The deployment reflects a real enterprise architecture. To avoid unnecessary Azure consumption charges, delete your instance of the preconfigured solution at azureiotsuite.com when you have finished with it. If you need the preconfigured solution again, you can easily recreate it. For more information about reducing consumption while the remote monitoring solution runs, see [Configuring Azure IoT Suite preconfigured solutions for demo purposes][lnk-demo-config].

## View the solution dashboard

The solution dashboard enables you to manage the deployed solution. For example, you can view telemetry, add devices, and invoke methods.

1. When the provisioning is complete and the tile for your preconfigured solution indicates **Ready**, choose **Launch** to open your remote monitoring solution portal in a new tab.

    ![Launch the preconfigured solution][img-launch-solution]

1. By default, the solution portal shows the *dashboard*. You can navigate to other areas of the solution portal using the menu on the left-hand side of the page.

    ![Remote monitoring preconfigured solution dashboard][img-menu]

## Add a device

For a device to connect to the preconfigured solution, it must identify itself to IoT Hub using valid credentials. You can retrieve the device credentials from the solution dashboard. You include the device credentials in your client application later in this tutorial.

If you haven't already done so, add a custom device to your remote monitoring solution. Complete the following steps in the solution dashboard:

1. In the lower left-hand corner of the dashboard, click **Add a device**.

   ![Add a device][1]

1. In the **Custom Device** panel, click **Add new**.

   ![Add a custom device][2]

1. Choose **Let me define my own Device ID**. Enter a Device ID such as **rasppi**, click **Check ID** to verify you haven't already used the name in your solution, and then click **Create** to provision the device.

   ![Add device ID][3]

1. Make a note the device credentials (**Device ID**, **IoT Hub Hostname**, and **Device Key**). Your client application on the Raspberry Pi needs these values to connect to the remote monitoring solution. Then click **Done**.

    ![View device credentials][4]

1. Select your device in the device list in the solution dashboard. Then, in the **Device Details** panel, click **Enable Device**. The status of your device is now **Running**. The remote monitoring solution can now receive telemetry from your device and invoke methods on the device.

## Prepare your Raspberry Pi

### Install Raspbian

If this is the first time you are using your Raspberry Pi, you need to install the Raspbian operating system using NOOBS on the SD card included in the kit. The [Raspberry Pi Software Guide][lnk-install-raspbian] describes how to install an operating system on your Raspberry Pi. This tutorial assumes you have installed the Raspbian operating system on your Raspberry Pi.


> The SD card included in the [Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi 3][lnk-starter-kits] already has NOOBS installed. You can boot the Raspberry Pi from this card and choose to install the Raspbian OS.

To complete the hardware setup, you need to:

- Connect your Raspberry Pi to the power supply included in the kit.
- Connect your Raspberry Pi to your network using the Ethernet cable included in your kit. Alternatively, you can set up [Wireless Connectivity][lnk-pi-wireless] for your Raspberry Pi.

You have now completed the hardware setup of your Raspberry Pi.

### Sign in and access the terminal

You have two options to access a terminal environment on your Raspberry Pi:

- If you have a keyboard and monitor connected to your Raspberry Pi, you can use the Raspbian GUI to access a terminal window.

- Access the command line on your Raspberry Pi using SSH from your desktop machine.

#### Use a terminal Window in the GUI

The default credentials for Raspbian are username **pi** and password **raspberry**. In the task bar in the GUI, you can launch the **Terminal** utility using the icon that looks like a monitor.

#### Sign in with SSH

You can use SSH for command-line access to your Raspberry Pi. The article [SSH (Secure Shell)][lnk-pi-ssh] describes how to configure SSH on your Raspberry Pi, and how to connect from [Windows][lnk-ssh-windows] or [Linux & Mac OS][lnk-ssh-linux].

Sign in with username **pi** and password **raspberry**.

#### Optional: Share a folder on your Raspberry Pi

Optionally, you may want to share a folder on your Raspberry Pi with your desktop environment. Sharing a folder enables you to use your preferred desktop text editor (such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)) to edit files on your Raspberry Pi instead of using `nano` or `vi`.

To share a folder with Windows, configure a Samba server on the Raspberry Pi. Alternatively, use the built-in [SFTP](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/) server with an SFTP client on your desktop.

## Download and configure the sample

You can now download and configure the remote monitoring client application on your Raspberry Pi.

### Clone the repositories

If you haven't already done so, clone the required repositories by running the following commands in a terminal on your Pi:

```sh
cd ~
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit.git
```

### Update the device connection string

Open the sample source file in the **nano** editor using the following command:

```sh
nano ~/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/simulator/remote_monitoring/remote_monitoring.c
```

Locate the following lines:

```c
static const char* deviceId = "[Device Id]";
static const char* connectionString = "HostName=[IoTHub Name].azure-devices.net;DeviceId=[Device Id];SharedAccessKey=[Device Key]";
```

Replace the placeholder values with the device and IoT Hub information you created and saved at the start of this tutorial. Save your changes (**Ctrl-O**, **Enter**) and exit the editor (**Ctrl-X**).

## Build the sample

Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by running the following commands in a terminal on the Raspberry Pi:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ make cmake git libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev
```

You can now build the updated sample solution on the Raspberry Pi:

```sh
chmod +x ~/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/simulator/build.sh
~/iot-remote-monitoring-c-raspberrypi-getstartedkit/simulator/build.sh
```

You can now run the sample program on the Raspberry Pi. Enter the command:

```sh
sudo ~/cmake/remote_monitoring/remote_monitoring
```

The following sample output is an example of the output you see at the command prompt on the Raspberry Pi:

![Output from Raspberry Pi app][img-raspberry-output]

Press **Ctrl-C** to exit the program at any time.

## View the telemetry

The Raspberry Pi is now sending telemetry to the remote monitoring solution. You can view the telemetry on the solution dashboard. You can also send messages to your Raspberry Pi from the solution dashboard.

- Navigate to the solution dashboard.
- Select your device in the **Device to View** dropdown.
- The telemetry from the Raspberry Pi displays on the dashboard.

![Display telemetry from the Raspberry Pi][img-telemetry-display]

## Act on the device

From the solution dashboard, you can invoke methods on your Raspberry Pi. When the Raspberry Pi connects to the remote monitoring solution, it sends information about the methods it supports.

- In the solution dashboard, click **Devices** to visit the **Devices** page. Select your Raspberry Pi in the **Device List**. Then choose **Methods**:

    ![List devices in dashboard][img-list-devices]

- On the **Invoke Method** page, choose **LightBlink** in the **Method** dropdown.

- Choose **InvokeMethod**. The simulator prints a message in the console on the Raspberry Pi. The app on the Raspberry Pi sends an acknowledgment back to the solution dashboard:

    ![Show method history][img-method-history]

- You can switch the LED on and off using the **ChangeLightStatus** method with a **LightStatusValue** set to **1** for on or **0** for off.
