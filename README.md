# Microsoft Azure IoT Suite 
You can deploy preconfigured solutions that implement common Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios to Microsoft Azure using your Azure subscription. You can use preconfigured solutions: 
- as a starting point for your own IoT solution. 
- to learn about the most common patterns in IoT solution design and development. 

Each preconfigured solution implements a common IoT scenario and is a complete, end-to-end implementation. You can deploy the Azure IoT Suite remote monitoring preconfigured solution from [https://www.azureiotsuite.com](https://www.azureiotsuite.com), following the guidance outlined in this [document](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/). In addition, you can download the complete source code from this repository to customize and extend the solution to meet your specific requirements. 

## Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution
The remote monitoring preconfigured solution illustrates how you can perform end-to-end monitoring. It brings together key Azure IoT services to enable the following features: data ingestion, device identity, command and control, rules and actions.
